# PaySwap Kernel — Worklog

---
Task ID: 1-6 (Global Liquidity OS pivot)
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Pivot the kernel from payment-centric to liquidity-state-centric (Global Liquidity OS). Replace RoutingEngine with LiquidityPlanner producing immutable LiquidityExecutionPlan; add Financial Operators, 8 liquidity sources, Insurance Engine, Manual Settlement Workflow, Treasury AI; rebuild Simulation as Digital Twin with failure injection + Time Machine; add Scenario Library.

Work Log:
- Rebuilt `types.ts` around canonical financial objects (Country, Corridor, Reserve, LiquidityProvider, FinancialOperator, Treasury, TwinToken, Wallet, Merchant, Customer) + LiquidityExecutionPlan (immutable DAG) + FailureInjection + PlanAmendment + OptimizationWeights + ObjectiveScore (explainable) + InsuranceClaim + Workflow + TreasuryRecommendation + ReplayFrame (expanded types: amendment/workflow/insurance/treasury) + SavedScenario/RegressionResult.
- Expanded `support.ts`: COUNTRIES registry, FO_META (9 FO types), PRIORITY_WEIGHTS (5 priorities → 8-dimension weight profiles), hashMetrics (regression).
- New `liquidity-planner.ts` (replaces routing.ts): generates 5 candidate plans (LP-bridge, reserve-first, fastest, diversified, treasury-backed), scores each across 8 explainable objectives, picks best, keeps top-3 alternatives with rejection reasons. Treasury candidate carries 30 bps cost so it's a genuine fallback. Policy-aware candidate generation.
- New `plan-executor.ts` (replaces settlement.ts): the SINGLE engine sim + production both call. Executes the immutable plan step-by-step. Failure injection at frames produces PlanAmendments (recovery sub-plans) — never silently fails. Handles: lp_disappear→treasury fallback, reserve_exhaustion→LP fallback, fx_spike→re-quote, manual_settlement→workflow, fraud_alert→block+insurance, compliance_block→halt, treasury_depletion, psp_timeout, network_partition, insurance_claim.
- New `treasury-ai.ts`: continuous recommendations (replenish reserve, prefer stablecoin, hold emergency, shift liquidity).
- New `insurance.ts`: claims with evidence/community vote/PaySwap vote/adjudication.
- Expanded `risk.ts`: multi-dimensional (reserve headroom, LP concentration, manual settlement, path, FX, treasury draw).
- Expanded `workflow.ts`: manual_settlement + insurance_claim workflow templates.
- Expanded `policy.ts`: reserve_policy + insurance_required rules.
- Expanded `treasury.ts`: stablecoin/emergency positions + drawStablecoin.
- Expanded `registry.ts`: 23 engines (added Liquidity Planner, Plan Executor, Treasury AI, Insurance; retitled Simulation→Digital Twin).
- New `scenario-library.ts`: save/load/regress. SavedScenario baseline hash + metrics; regress() compares current vs baseline with drift tolerance.
- Rebuilt `simulation.ts` as Digital Twin: planner→executor→replay. Builds 10+ frame Time Machine timeline (debit/credit/mint/burn/ledger/events/ai/amendments/workflows/insurance/treasury/settlement).
- `index.ts`: new barrel + defaultScenario (canonical Kenya→Ghana) + libraryScenarios (5 regression scenarios: canonical, reserve exhaustion+manual, dual LP failure, Nigeria PSP outage, peak harvest, fraud alert).

Stage Summary:
- Kernel verified via direct tsx runs: default scenario picks LP bridge (Baobab 10k exhausted → Acacia 15k, 1% cost, risk 0.13 Low) with 3 alternatives.
- All 6 library scenarios execute correctly: failure injection produces amendments + workflows + insurance claims + treasury recs. Fraud alert blocks settlement (settled=false) + insurance claim denied. Ledger balances in every case.
- Next: Prisma schema (SavedScenario), API routes (/api/simulate, /api/scenarios), Digital Twin UI rebuild.

Task ID: 7-10 (Prisma + API + Digital Twin UI + verification)
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Prisma schema for scenarios, API routes (/api/simulate, /api/scenarios, /api/scenarios/regress), rebuild UI as Digital Twin, verify with Agent Browser.

Work Log:
- Prisma schema: SimulationRun (with resultHash/priority/settled/amendments/failures), LedgerEntryRecord, TwinTokenRecord, PlanAmendmentRecord, AuditLog, SavedScenarioRecord (baseline hash + metrics + lastRunPassed). Force-reset DB (old test data incompatible), pushed + generated client.
- API /api/simulate: GET returns default scenario + engines + library scenarios + FO metadata. POST runs the Digital Twin, enhances AI narrative via z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM (best-effort fallback), persists run + ledger + twin tokens + amendments + audit.
- API /api/scenarios: GET lists saved. POST runs scenario + captures baseline + upserts to DB. DELETE removes.
- API /api/scenarios/regress: re-runs every saved scenario against current kernel, compares metrics vs baseline (cost drift <0.3%, risk drift <0.1, hash match), returns drift report.
- UI rebuilt as Digital Twin (src/components/simulator/):
  * scenario-builder.tsx — accordion: Transaction / Treasury & Reserves / Liquidity Providers (with source kind, manual, online) / Financial Operators / Failure Injection (10 failure types) / AI Weights (8 sliders).
  * execution-graph.tsx — vertical step flow of the immutable plan (13 step types, recovery/manual badges, frame markers).
  * ai-reasoning.tsx — strategy + weighted score + LLM badge + 8 objective score bars (explainable) + decision trace + AlternativesPanel (rejected routes with reasons).
  * metrics-panel.tsx — 4 metric cards + utilization bars + FX + insurance exposure.
  * replay-stepper.tsx — Time Machine: play/pause/step, frame chips (incl. RECOVERY), detail renderers for amendment/workflow/insurance/treasury/ledger/events/AI.
  * world-state.tsx — reserves (before→after, delta, healthy) + LPs (used/remaining, source kind, online/manual) + FOs (used, online, uptime).
  * treasury-amendments.tsx — Treasury AI recommendations + Plan Amendments panel (triggered-by, recovery strategy).
  * scenario-library.tsx — save current / load saved / delete / run regression with pass/drift display.
- src/app/page.tsx: orchestrator. Library scenario chips (one-click load), sticky left column (builder + library), right results column. Footer sticky with run hash + settled/blocked.
- Fixed: Prisma client regenerated after schema change (dev server cached old client). Regression endpoint made resilient to missing DB records.
- Verified via Agent Browser:
  * Default scenario: LP bridge (Baobab 10k exhausted → Acacia 15k), 1% cost, risk 0.13 Low, 3 alternatives, 10 replay frames. VLM: "No defects".
  * Reserve exhaustion + manual settlement: 1 amendment (LP fallback) + manual settlement workflow (4/4 steps) + 2 treasury recs + High risk.
  * Fraud alert: blocked (settled=false) + insurance claim denied + Recovery frame in Time Machine.
  * Time Machine Recovery frame: shows "Block + insurance claim" recovery strategy.
  * Scenario Library: save via API works, regression PASS (0% drift, hash match).
  * `bun run lint` clean. Dev log error-free.

Stage Summary:
- PaySwap Kernel pivoted from payment-centric to Global Liquidity OS (Milestone 1 complete).
- 23 engines. Immutable LiquidityExecutionPlan (planner + alternatives + explainable 8-objective AI).
- Unified PlanExecutor (sim = production). Failure injection → plan amendments (10 failure types).
- Digital Twin: scenario builder + execution graph + alternatives + Time Machine + world state + treasury AI + 23-engine registry.
- Scenario Library: save/load/regress (continuous verification). LLM-powered AI narrative.
- All 5 definition-of-done criteria met.

Task ID: FOS-1 (Financial Operating System)
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Evolve kernel from Global Liquidity OS to full Financial Operating System. Add Financial Graph (nodes + weighted edges), Kernel Constitution (non-overridable invariants), Developer API facade (kernel.plan/simulate/execute/replay/validate/graph), named event catalog (event sourcing), LP lifecycle (stake/withdraw/restake/suspend/slash), smart contract interfaces, World Inspector with per-frame deltas.

Work Log:
- New `financial-graph.ts`: GraphNode (wallet/reserve/lp/treasury/stablecoin/fo/insurance_pool) + GraphEdge (9 weighted properties: cost, latency, reliability, liquidity, trust, settlement, carbon, impact, compliance). buildGraph() constructs the graph from world state. findPaths() traverses via DFS. mixPaths() enables composable source mixing (40% reserve + 35% LP + 25% treasury).
- New `constitution.ts`: 10 non-overridable invariants — ledger balanced, twin token backed, no negative balances, reserve threshold, manual settlement requires insurance, fallback path, event emission, no double spend, no duplicate settlement, LP capacity respected. evaluateConstitution() gates every plan. The financial equivalent of ACID guarantees.
- New `api.ts`: Developer API facade — kernel.plan(), kernel.simulate(), kernel.execute(), kernel.replay(), kernel.validate(), kernel.world(), kernel.treasury(), kernel.insurance(), kernel.graph(). Plus LiquidityIntent (extensions request, never execute) + intentToScenario().
- New `events.ts`: Named event catalog (event sourcing) — 40+ canonical event types (PlanCreated, ReserveDebited, LPSelected, Minted, Burned, ManualSettlementStarted, InsuranceOpened, ConstitutionChecked, LPSuspended, etc.). EVENT_LABELS for human display.
- New `lp-lifecycle.ts`: LP lifecycle engine (stake/withdraw/restake/suspend/reactivate/slash) + smart contract interfaces (TwinTokenContract, LiquidityPoolContract, TreasuryContract, InsuranceContract, GovernanceContract). Routing stays off-chain; settlement proofs go on-chain.
- Updated `simulation.ts`: builds financial graph, evaluates constitution post-execution, builds World Inspector (per-frame deltas for ledger/reserves/LPs/treasury/twinTokens/events), initializes LP lifecycle stakes, emits named events (PlanCreated, ExecutionCompleted, ConstitutionChecked).
- Updated `types.ts`: added ConstitutionVerdict, GraphSnapshot, WorldInspector, FrameDelta, LiquidityIntent, LPStake, LPLifecycleEvent. SimulationResult now includes constitution, graph, worldInspector, lpLifecycleEvents.
- Updated `registry.ts`: 26 engines (added Financial Graph, Kernel Constitution, LP Lifecycle, Developer API). Version 0.3.0-financial-os.
- New UI components: constitution-panel.tsx (10 invariant checks with pass/fail), financial-graph.tsx (nodes grouped by type + weighted edges), world-inspector.tsx (per-frame deltas with before/after), lp-lifecycle.tsx (stake/withdraw/restake events).
- Updated page.tsx: Constitution panel below metrics, Financial Graph + Alternatives side-by-side, World Inspector + World State side-by-side, LP Lifecycle + Treasury AI side-by-side. Title "Financial Operating System". Footer shows constitution status.

Stage Summary:
- Kernel is now a Financial Operating System. Every operation = state transition through global liquidity graph.
- Kernel Constitution: 10 non-overridable invariants gate every plan. Default scenario: ALL PASSED (10/10). Reserve-exhaustion scenario: VIOLATED (catches negative balance + threshold breach).
- Financial Graph: 13 nodes + 17 edges. Developer API: kernel.graph() returns traversable graph.
- World Inspector: per-frame deltas (ledger/reserves/LPs/treasury/tokens/events) — the debugger view.
- LP Lifecycle: stake events recorded. Named events: 40+ canonical types.
- 26 engines. Lint clean. Agent Browser verified: constitution gating works (✓ for default, ✗ for failures). VLM: "No defects".
